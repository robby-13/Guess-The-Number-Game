Simple Python program that utilizes built-in functions, user input, for loops and conditionals. The game allows the user a maximum of six attempts to guess the randomly generated number (thanks to the random module). Depending on the user's input, the program produces an output message signifying whether the user's guess is too high or too low. In the case that the user's guess is correct, the program ends and prints to the screen a congratulatory message along with the number of attempts it took the user to guess correctly. However, if the user is not successful in all six attempts, then the program terminates and prints to the screen a message informing the user of what the number was.
